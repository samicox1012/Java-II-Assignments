# Java-II-Assignments
 * ***********************************************
 * Chapter 2 Assignment 1
 * This program demonstrates use of an interface to 
 * set up constants and demand use of certain methods
 * by the class that implement it.
 * 
 * ***********************************************

 * ***************************************************
 * Chapter 3 Assignment 1
 * This program demonstrates use of an Array Stack
 * to push, top, pop, print, and check for 
 * fullness/emptiness of a stack.
 * 
 * ***************************************************
 
 * ***********************************************
 * Chapter 4 Assignment 1
 * This program demonstrates use of recursion as well
 * as an applet and gui  to allow the user to find the 
 * Fibonacci calculation for a num. Stalls around 40 
 *  
 * ***********************************************

 * ***************************************************
 * Chapter 5 Assignment 1
 * This program demonstrates use of a Linked Stack
 * and Linked Queue to push, top, pop, print, and check
 * for fullness/emptiness of a stack. This is done by 
 * allowing the user to enter a string, the program puts 
 * the string into both a stack and a queue, then removes 
 * each char, comparing them for equivalence. 
 *

 * ***************************************************
 * Chapter 6 Assignment 1
 * This program demonstrates use of the List ADT. This is 
 * done by having the computer generate 20 random numbers, 
 * entering them into the list, and testing the equivalence 
 * of each one singularly against the contents of the list,
 * to determine how many of each number it generated.
